# Notification Sample App  ( Android & IOS )

The Flutter notification sample app showcases push notification implementation for iOS and Android. It highlights using APNs for iOS and FCM for Android, demonstrating notification handling across different app states and allowing users to subscribe to various notification channels.

In this project we are using the clean architecture  with following folder breakup -> Parent folder - ( View, Bloc, Network ). We are using the modular approach for reduce the modular dependency between the each module of the project. Clean architecture also decouple the presentation layer and business layer.
